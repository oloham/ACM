# ACM
This repository displays an attempt of implementation of axiomatic conjoint measurement theory (aka. ACM) for psychological tests with ordinal items. 

In general, ACM's aim is to check if a measured object is in fact quantifiable. Therefore it provides a robust tool to indirectly test theories in medicine or social sciences, as psychology or economy. 

This implementation operates on a temperament test PTS by Strealu and Zawadzki with four-levels ordinal scale, 57 items and three subtests. 

It showcases my skills in programming, data analysis and ability to read advanced mathematical theories.
